        <p>A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation. Most definitions of cars say that
          they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people rather
          than goods.[2][3]

          Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them. The year 1886 is
          regarded as the birth year of the car when German inventor Karl Benz patented his Benz
          Patent-Motorwagen.[1][4][5] Cars became widely available in the early 20th century. One of the first cars
          accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars
          were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts.[6] In Europe and other
          parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.[6]

          Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lights. Over the decades,
          additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex. These
          include rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment. Most cars in
          use in the early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil
          fuels. Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became commercially available in
          the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy than gasoline cars before 2025.[7][8] The transition from
          fossil fuels to electric cars features prominently in most climate change mitigation scenarios,[9] such as
          Project Drawdown's 100 actionable solutions for climate change.
